A study guide to help get through the coding boot camp prework

## Description

This is a study guide that provides some of the highlights of what a student will learn in preparation for the Coding Boot Camp they are about to take.  

- My motivation was to capture the key highlights of what I needed to learn first while taking on a new challenge in a new career field.
- I built this project so I had an easy reference guide to go back to for learning and to memorialize the first step in a long journey.
- It solves the problem of having to memorize these early learning points.  Why memorize and use energy when you can look it up?
- I learned that coding can be fun.  Starting with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git and GitHub are great foundations to build upon.  I also realized that the more you learn in coding, the more you realize you don't know.
